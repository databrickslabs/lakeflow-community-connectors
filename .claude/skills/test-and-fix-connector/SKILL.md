# Test and Fix the Connector

## Description

This skill helps you validate a connector implementation by executing the provided test suite, diagnosing test failures, and applying minimal, targeted fixes until all tests pass. It also validates connector schemas against live API responses to catch discrepancies. It guides you through setting up tests, running them against real source systems, and iteratively fixing issues.
